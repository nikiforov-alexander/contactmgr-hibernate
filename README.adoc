== Description

This application is enhancement of https://github.com/treehouse/contactmgr-hibernate[Contact Manager GitHub Repo]
that is following https://teamtreehouse.com/library/hibernate-basics[Hibernate Basics course on Treehouse].

The goal of this Fork is to provide example of how one can use DAO
pattern to re-write this application, and encapsulate logic of 
database interactions behind the {ContactDao} interface and {ContactDaoImpl}.

This application also shows how one can use Unit Testing to test 
DAO interactions, see {ContactDaoTest}.

=== How to Run

I like to run H2 Database in a Server-Mode as often as possible.
Especially when it comes to learning purposes. This way person
can open database GUI (for H2 database) and watch how his actual
database is changed. It is exteremely helpful for beginners, that 
make mistakes and want to see what is wrong.

I added `h2-1.4.193` file in the root directory for convenience.

Before running `main` method of {Application} class from IDE, one has
to *start H2 server*. http://www.h2database.com/html/cheatSheet.html[This] is
the official reference how to start. https://teamtreehouse.com/library/create-a-sessionfactory-and-datasource[This] 
is the video where https://github.com/christherama[Chris Ramacciotti]
does that for https://teamtreehouse.com/library/spring-with-hibernate[Spring with Hibernate course]

From Intellijdea one simply presses `Alt+<F12>` to open a terminal
and run 

```text
java -cp h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Server
```

Otherwise one can open Terminal or Command Prompt and go to project root, i.e.
where `h2-1.4.193.jar` file lies and run the command above.

Automatically program will open Browser with H2 GUI

The message in console is usually like this

```text
TCP server running at tcp://127.0.1.1:9092 (only local connections)
PG server running at pg://127.0.1.1:5435 (only local connections)
Web Console server running at http://127.0.1.1:8082 (only local connections)
```

Alternatively one can go directly to `http://127.0.1.1:8082` and see H2 GUI.

In this window one simply picks proper `JDBC URL`, `username` and `password` 
*according to* {hiberate_cfg_xml} given.

So for our application it is these lines from {hiberate_cfg_xml}

```XML
       <property name="connection.url">jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/./data/contactmgr</property>

       <property name="connection.username">sa</property>

       <property name="connection.password">sa</property>
```
